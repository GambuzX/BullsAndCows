# BullsAndCows :cow: :video_game:

### Context
Game developed while following the "The Unreal Engine Developer Course" online course. I took the lectures as a basis to create something to my own liking and this was the result.

### Description
Console word-guessing game based on MasterMind.

The objective is to guess the hidden word.
You are only given the length of the hidden word and, for each guess you make, the number of bulls and cows associated.
* A bull is a correct letter in the right place.
* A cow is a correct letter in the wrong place.

#### Have fun!
